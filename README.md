# Ultimate BlackJack
This project for my Fundamentals of Engineering class was made with the purpose to create a game that contributed some value to society. This simple and easy-to-play game utilizes custom pixel graphics, a clean UX, and instant statistics that are able to be saved. In order to promote education, the user is able to answer questions relating to engineering fundamentals in order to earn more chips to play the game with. 
This game was programmed using C and using OSU's College of Engineering's Proteus Simulator with its respective libraries.
